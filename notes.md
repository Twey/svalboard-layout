# Hardware notes
- The raised thumb triggers cannot be easily combined with the thumb-down buttons
- Opposite directions cannot be combined (duh)
- Centre + direction is harder to combine than you might think;
  neighbouring directions are better
# Software notes
- I'd really like `LM(3, MOD_LGUI)` in a bunch of places, but it
  doesn't seem to work (just sends `LGUI` without switching layer)
# Transition notes
default → steno: right trigger, left trigger
default → game: left trigger, right trigger
default → WM: right trigger + right pad GUI, left down shift
steno → WM control: right trigger + right pad GUI
# Layer 0: Hands Down Promethium
- Modifiers on the right thumb, next to each other so they can be
  combined arbitrarily
- Bottom-row shift on the ring because I'm less likely to fumble it (?)
# Layer 1: Steno with combined keys
- Travel is cheap on the Sval, and centre is difficult to combine, so
  we use combined keys? Note to self: maybe this is worse than using
  up/down — TSDZ are a bit squashed
- Laterals are used for star
- Lapwing-like number
## Alternative idea
- Combine neighbouring keys (in/down), use centre for star and up for
  number
# Layer 2: Symbols and numbers
- symbols get primacy because I'm a coder
- numbers on top row, brackets on bottom row, symbols in the middle
- numbers in Dvorak order: odds on the left, evens on the right, 0 and 9 on 5-out
# Layer 3: WM control
- F-keys arranged the same as the numbers, with the extra on 5-south
- Arrows are here, using my WASD-mapping
# Layer 4: gaming
- disables trackball
- SOCD on the Dvorak ./O (bottom wins because it's too easy to hit
  centre by mistake) and E/U (last wins)
# Trackball
- sends button 12 when left trackball moved — mapped to scroll button
  in X11
- Windows only supports mouse buttons up to 5 :( and I use them all so
  no option for scroll button in Windows
- Maybe 12 maps to button-9 (browser forward), in which case I could
  bind it carefully
- Sniper button on left-trigger, escape mouse-mode with right-trigger
